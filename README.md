# Awesome Semantic Shapes [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of Semantic Shapes resources. Contributions welcome!
> Please, read the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

Semantic shapes enable you to validate RDF graphs against a set of conditions.
Semantic shapes can also be viewed as a description of data graphs that satisfy these conditions.
Such descriptions may be used for a variety of purposes beside validation,
including user interface building, code generation and data integration.
Semantic shapes could be described in SHACL or ShEx languages.
