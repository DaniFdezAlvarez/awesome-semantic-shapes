## How to add a new category

If you are creating a new category, move the projects that apply to the new category, ensuring
that the resulting list has at least 3 projects in every category, and that the categories are alphabetized.

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to

the existing one.
